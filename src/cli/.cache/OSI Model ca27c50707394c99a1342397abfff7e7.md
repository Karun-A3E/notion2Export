### Physical Layer  (Layer 1)

The physical layer is the first layer in the OSI, it is the layer where the bits are transmitted to the network and includes all of the physical and electrical characteristics of the network.

- [ ]  What is meant by  - - *Physical and electrical characteristics of the network* - - isâ€¦
    - The layer is responsible for transmitting the bits in accordance to the way the device is connected to the network whether it is :
        - CAT5
        - CAT6
        - Wi-Fi

Regardless of which method the bits are going to be transmitted over the network, it will always be in the form of `0` and `1` . Which represent binary code, that computers use to communicate with one another. `Hence, regardless of whatever media, the bits are going to be sent over as 1 and 0`

Medias used in Physical Layer : 

1. Copper Wire â†’ `CAT5` and `CAT6` 
    1. In this sort of media, the bits are transmitted in accordance to the voltage where `0 bit` can mean 0V. `1 bit` can mean -5V or 5V. This is called `Transition Modulation`
2. Fiber Optic Cable 
    1. In this sort of cable, the presence of Light can represent `1 bit` and the absence is `0 bit`

<aside>
ðŸ“¡ `Transition Modulation` is where, in a media or wire, 1 level represents `1 bit` and another level represents `0 bit`

</aside>

*How are the cables wired ???*

If we are using something like a `CAT5` or `CAT6` there is the connector at the end called `RJ45` , this allows the cable to be connected to the computer or to the switch.

The way the connector is connected depends on the standards used : 

- TIA/EIA-568A
- TIA/EIA-568B

These cables tells use whether the cross-over cable or straight-thru cable

- Cross-over cable
    
    If a Cross-Over cable is used, then we are going to flip the transmission and receive bit on the end of the cable, whereby one end will be Standard A and the other Standard B.
    
- Straight-Thru cable
    
    If we are using Straight-Thru Cable then we are going to have Standard B cables on both sides
    

> Layer 1 view networks from a physical topology perspective i.e. how the network is connected
> 

*How is communication synchronized ???*

Communication can be transmitted `synchronously` or `asynchronously` .

- Asynchronous Communication
    
    In Asynchronous communication, the analogy is ; voicemail. In voicemail, even though the receiving does not pick up the call, the message is still read by the recipient from the voicemail.
    
    In network this same action occurs via a `start` and `stop` bit, to indicate when the transmissions occur from the sender and receiver.
    
    > Thus `asynchronous` communication occurs out of time, where there is connection established depending on when the `start and stop` bit are sent.
    > 
- Synchronous Communication
    
    In Synchronous communication, the analogy is ; picking up the call. Assuming the recipient actually picked up the call, then both parties are communicating at the real time.
    
    Unlike `asynchronous` in `synchronous` a reference clock is used to coordinate by the transmission by both sender and receiver.
    

*How is bandwidth utilized ???*

The Bandwidth refers to the speed at which bits are being transferred

In Utilizing Bandwidth, there are 2 ways you can approach it : `Broadband` and `Baseband`.

- Broadband
    
    In broadband, the bandwidth is going to be separate to serve each channels.
    
    For eg, in cable Tv : 
    
    - There are over 200 channels coming in via the same cable, but how is it that we can play 1 channel at a time???
        - This is a application of broadband, in it, there are multiple frequencies and each have their own bandwidth, once a channel is chosen, the remaining frequencies are all filtered out.
- Baseband
    
    In baseband, all the available frequencies are used on the medium to transmit the data
    
    For eg, in Telephone â†’ Landline : 
    
    - In a Landline, we make use of all the bandwidth allocated to it, to communicate over it.
        - This is because unlike in cable TV in which there are multiple frequencies â†’ 200 channels, in a telephone there is only 1 frequency going through at a time, such that we can talk to one person at a time.
    
    Baseband uses a reference clock, allows us to send the information for both the sender and receiver at the certain time.
    
    An example of a Baseband Network is a wired home ethernet Network, because we are goin to use all the frequency that is available on the cable giving the devices more bandwidth then on broadband
    
    In Baseband, the cable makes use of the bandwidth completely, in order to maximize, the efficiency and make more of it, there are certain mechanisms like : `TDM` and `StatTMD`.
    
    - `TDM` â†’ Time-Division Multiplexing
        
        Each session takes a turn, using time-slots, to share the medium between all users
        
    - `StatTDM` â†’ Statistical Time-Division Multiplexing
        
        Dynamically allocating the time slots on a as-needed basis
        
    - `FDM` â†’ Frequency-Division Multiplexing
        
        Divides the medium into channels based on frequencies and each session is transmitted over a different channel
        
    
    <aside>
    ðŸ’¡ `Multiplexing` is getting more out a limited network
    
    </aside>
    
    1. Fiber optic cable
    2. Ethernet Cable
    3. Coaxial Cable

The above are physical 1 devices â†’ wired at least

Beyond Wired Cable, there are wireless as well : 

- Bluetooth
- Wi-fi
- NFC â†’ Near-Field Communication

The below are infrastructure access points  :

- Hubs
- Access points

<aside>
â›” Layer 1 Devices are dumb devices, they basically repeat the incoming data and repeat whatever they receive to the other end.

</aside>

---

### Data Link Layer (Layer 2)

In the Data Link Layer, the bits that are converted to Frames, there a certain number of devices that operate in this layer : 

1. Switch
2. NIC â†’ Network-Interface Card

In the Data Link layer there are sub-layers and they are `MAC` and `LLC`.

- `LLC` â†’ Logical Link Control
    
    *In the Data Link Layer, there is something called Flow control, what is it ???*
    
    The main functionality of the LLC layer is that it multiplexes the protocols over the MAC layer while sending and de-multiplex the protocols while receiving. This layer controls the flow control.
    
    The error-checking of the data link layer is performed by LLC. It can also track the acknowledgments.
    
    While transmitting data, if LLC detects any frame loss, immediately it sends back to the source to transmit over again. The LLC layer comes above the MAC layer and acts as an interface between the upper layers and the MAC layer.
    
    - Provides connection services and allows acknowledgement of receipt of messages
        - Basically it limits the amount of data the sender can send at once
        - Prevents the receiver from getting overwhelmed
        - Either to ask for less info or repeat the info
    - Provides basic error control functions
        - Informs the sender if the data has not reached or it is corrupted
        - How does it know it is corrupted ???
            - It receives `1` and `0` and does a checksum based of it.
    
    ![https://www.tutorialspoint.com/assets/questions/media/56521/osi_model.jpg](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/assets/questions/media/56521/osi_model.jpg)
    
    - The primary function of LLC is to multiplex protocols over the MAC layer while transmitting and likewise to de-multiplex the protocols while receiving.
    - LLC provides hop-to-hop flow and error control.
    - It allows multipoint communication over computer network.
    - Frame Sequence Numbers are assigned by LLC.
    - In case of acknowledged services, it tracks acknowledgements
    
- `MAC` â†’ Media Access Control
    
    MAC â†’ Media Access Control, is a uniquely assigned address, that is made up of 48bits eg. **00:00:5e:00:53:af .** The Address is represented in a hexadecimal format, whereby each decimal is 4bit and the first half or 6 of the hexadecimals represent the vendor address and the remaining represent the unique machine address.
    
    The MAC address is like the `name` of the receiver or the `home address` of the receiver, there must be a unique MAC addresses on a network, if not the network will fail. Since, the purpose of the MAC address is a set of a Unique identification for devices.
    
    The NIC is responsible for allowing the device it is to, connect to the network. The NIC also contains the deviceâ€™s MAC address.
    

*Synchronous Communication*

- Isochronous
    
    > Network devices use a common reference clock source and create time slots for transmission very similar to `TDM` or `StatTDM`
    >

### Network Layer  (Layer 3)

In the Network Layer, it is responsible for forwarding traffic `routing` with the logical address.

The Network layer deals with the IP `Internet Protocol` the internet Protocol is just one of the protocols that are applied in this layer, of course there are other protocols but this protocol is still the most commonly implemented one. The `IP` follows 2 different schemes `IPV4` && `IPV6` . The latter is a newly designed scheme, both these schemes play a role in assigning hosts, such that the number of host in `IPV6` far exceeds `IPV4`.

This layer mainly deals with data in the form of a Packet, when the frame from the Data-Link layer arrives in the Network layer, the Network Layer de-capsulates the frame to form a packet, this packet contains the IP addresses of the DST and SRC.

<aside>
â›” How exactly is data forwarded or route the data across the networks

</aside>

The 3 main ways this is done so : `Packet Switching` , `Circuit Switching`, `Message Switching`.

> In the network layer, the term `switching` refers to `routing`, ***not the switch in data-link layer***
> 

The most common way of routing is Packet Switching, this is where segmented data are converted to packets via encapsulation in the network layer.

**Packet switching**
Â is a method of transferring the data to a network in form of packets. In order to transfer the file fast and efficiently manner over the network and minimize the transmission latency, the data is broken into small pieces of variable length, calledÂ **Packet.** At the destination, all these small parts (packets) have to be reassembled, belonging to the same file.

![https://networkencyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hop.jpg](https://networkencyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hop.jpg)

Additionally, by connecting the Routers, they can decide the shortest distance to the intended router, this is done by the routers constantly communicating with one another. Once they sending `router` knows the shortest distance, it will then forward it that way.

![https://www.iusmentis.com/technology/tcpip/networks/tcpipnetworksfig5.png](https://www.iusmentis.com/technology/tcpip/networks/tcpipnetworksfig5.png)

In these 2 Figures, there are a list of routers connected to one another. Assume, R1 receives a data bit, it will decapsulate and read the DST IP address, then it will refer it to the routing table. If it knows where the DST router is it will forward the bit to the specific router if not, the router will send this data to the all the router it is connected to, in that at least 1 should know where the DST is.

![https://cdn.comparitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/packet-switching-1024x427.jpg.webp](https://cdn.comparitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/packet-switching-1024x427.jpg.webp)

This Diagram shows that there are multiple routes from terminal 1 to terminal 2, and so in a real-life context, depending on the network traffic and other variables, the optimal route will be calculated by the router.

Packet Switching usesÂ **Store and Forward**
Â technique while switching the packets; while forwarding the packet each hop first stores that packet then forward. This technique is very beneficial because packets may get discarded at any hop due to some reason. More than one path is possible between a pair of sources and destinations. Each packet contains Source and destination address using which they independently travel through the network. In other words, packets belonging to the same file may or may not travel through the same path. If there is congestion at some path, packets are allowed to choose different paths possible over an existing network.

Hence the entire idea of Packet Switching is, the Data will keep on hopping from one router to the other, until it finds it intended target.

Advantages :  

- More efficient in terms of bandwidth, since the concept of reserving circuit is not there.
- Minimal transmission latency.
- More reliable as a destination can detect the missing packet.
- More fault tolerant because packets may follow a different path in case any link is down, Unlike Circuit Switching.
- Cost-effective and comparatively cheaper to implement.

Disadvantages : 

- Packet Switching doesnâ€™t give packets in order, whereas Circuit Switching provides ordered delivery of packets because all the packets follow the same path.
- Since the packets are unordered, we need to provide sequence numbers for each packet.
- Complexity is more at each node because of the facility to follow multiple paths.
- Transmission delay is more because of rerouting.
- Packet Switching is beneficial only for small messages, but for bursty data (large messages) Circuit Switching is better.

`Circuit Switching`, this is another way of routing data ; this is where there is a dedicated communication link established between 2 devices .

![https://cdn.comparitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Circuit-Switching-1024x427.jpg.webp](https://cdn.comparitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Circuit-Switching-1024x427.jpg.webp)

In the circuit switching, there is a permanent, dedicated link being established, this is when there are already pre-loaded route. Such that the administrator specifically wants the data to be transmitted from terminal 1 to 2 in a specific route.

Example of application of Circuit Switching is as follows : 

- Audio Communication

`Message Switching` is the third way, the data is routed towards the destination, the Message Switching is a network switching strategy in which data or message is transmitted entirely from the source to the destination node, one hop at a time. Every intermediary switch in the network stores the entire message during message routing. In this routing, dynamic routing is used unlike in circuit routing.

Normally, when the intended DST is not recognized by the intermediate nodes, the data is deleted, or when the DST device is offline. However, in this strategy the Data is stored.

**Message Switching â€“**Â Message switching was a technique developed as an alternative to circuit switching before packet switching was introduced. In message switching, end-users communicate by sending and receivingÂ *messages*Â that included the entire data to be shared. Messages are the smallest individual unit.Â Also, the sender and receiver are not directly connected. There are a number of intermediate nodes that transfer data and ensure that the message reaches its destination. Message switched data networks are hence called hop-by-hop systems.

They provide 2 distinct and important characteristics:

1. **Store and forward â€“**Â The intermediate nodes have the responsibility of transferring the entire message to the next node. Hence, each node must have storage capacity. A message will only be delivered if the next hop and the link connecting it are both available, otherwise, itâ€™ll be stored indefinitely. A store-and-forward switch forwards a message only if sufficient resources are available and the next hop is accepting data. This is called the store-and-forward property.Â 
2. **Message delivery â€“**Â This implies wrapping the entire information in a single message and transferring it from the source to the destination node. Each message must have a header that contains the message routing information, including the source and destination.

Differences : 

| Message | Packet |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A complete message is passed across a network. | Message is broken into smaller units known as Packets. |  |
| In this, computer language used is ASCII, baudot, morse. | In packet switching, binary type is used. |  |
| In message switching there is no limit on block size. | Packet switching places a tight upper limit on block size. |  |
| Message exist only in one location in the network. | Parts i.e. packets of the message exist in many places in the network. |  |
| Example: Hop-by-hop Telex forwarding and UUCP(UNIX-to-UNIX Copy Protocol) | Example: Frame Relay, IP, and X. 25 |  |
| Physical links are allocated dynamically. | Virtual links are made simultaneously. |  |
| Access time is reduced due to increase in performance as packets are stored in disk. | Packets are stored in main memory. |  |

**Advantages of Message Switching â€“**Â Message switching has the following advantages:

1. As message switching is able to store the message for which communication channel is not available, it helps in reducing the traffic congestion in the network.
2. In message switching, the data channels are shared by the network devices.
3. It makes traffic management efficient by assigning priorities to the messages.
4. Because the messages are delivered via a store and forward method, it is possible to include priority in them.
5. It allows for infinite message lengths.
6. Unlike circuit switching, it does not necessitate the actual connection of source and destination devices.

**Disadvantages of Message Switching â€“**Â Message switching has the following disadvantages:

1. Message switching cannot be used for real-time applications as storing messages causes delay.
2. In message switching, the message has to be stored for which every intermediate device in the network requires a large storing capacity.
3. Because the system is so intricate, people are frequently unaware of whether or not messages are correctly conveyed. This could cause problems in social relationships.
4. The type of message switching does not create a dedicated path between the devices. It is not dependable communication because there is no direct relationship between sender and receiver.

**Applications â€“**

The store-and-forward method was implemented in telegraph message switching centers. Today, although many major networks and systems are packet-switched or circuit-switched networks, their delivery processes can be based on message switching. For example, in most electronic mail systems the delivery process is based on message switching, while the network is in fact either circuit-switched or packet-switched.

### Transport Layer (Layer 4)

This layer is responsible in providing the communication services directly to the application processes running on different hosts. Basically, this layer exists so as to ensure `smooth handover of data` . 

The #3 Main Functions of the Transport layer â†’ `Segmentation` , `Flow Control` and `Error Contorl`. In this layer, we are also going to focus on certain protocols and they are `TCP- Transmission Control Protocol` & `UDP- User Datagram Protocol` . 

*Flow Control* â†’ `What is it` ??? 

- [ ]  Flow control. the best analogy to explain what flow control is, assume that flow control is like a normal road ; A road that has a junction, highway and everything. Letâ€™s the highway speed is 80km/h while the normal lane speed is only 40km/h and beyond that can cause in accidents, to prevent this there is a constable.
    - In Transport Layer, it is the same exact thing, assume the mobile connected to the router can only get data at 1Mps Speed and the router can provide up to 50Mpbs. The Mobile processor is not the as fast as the Router is, it cannot possible be able to receive all the the info, as while the phone receives this data, it must also perform checksum and error control. Hence, with that, the Mobile must be able to receive the data at a slower speed.
    - To receive the data at a slower pace, the transport layer in the receive end, will establish a connection with the router to inform it to receive the data in a slower pace.
    - The Techniques this layer performs to do Flow control is : `Buffering` and `Window Scaling` .
1. `Buffering` â†’ 
    1. Buffering is one of the techniques used in Flow control, it is used to allow smooth flow of data, ensuring limited amount of data is lost. Currently most of the networks are implementing the `Packet Switching` Technique, it is the technique where the packet hops from one router to the other, whilst the packet is jumping, this packet is usually stored in the router temporarily.  This store âˆ’ and âˆ’ forward packet switching is a technique where the data packets are stored in each intermediate node, before they are forwarded to the next node. The intermediate node checks whether the packet is errorâˆ’free before transmitting, thus ensuring integrity of the data packets. The concept of buffering is very similar to some aspect.
        1. Imagine a Junction, this 4-way junction, of which only 1 leads to the highway. This junction has no signals or whatsoever, while the main road has multiple vehicles, running the remaining are held back, until there is space for them to join the traffic and move forward.
    2. Hence, similarly, assume the destination is full of data traffic â†’ *no space for anymore vehicles* . **What can they do ???** Well, this is when buffer comes in, basically, the packets that are yet to arrive in the destination are held back and temporarily stored in the Router.
2. `Window Scaling` â†’
    1. sliding window protocol controls and optimizes packet flow between a sender and receiver, in transport layer, there are 4 different types of mode the client is on : 
        1. Received and Acknowledged the message
        2. Did not receive the message but is ready to receive them
        3. message is sent but not acknowledged
        4. Do not want message and it is not willing to receive it
    2. Basically, windows allows the client to adjust the amount of data it is willing to receive at a moment of time.
        1. Back to the Junction topic, lets say the in the highway all the vehicles travel to 60km/h, but the check post cannot possible be able to facilitate the change over of border of this many vehicles at the same time. 
        2. Imagine 100 cars trying to get past 2 check post, this is too many cars, so what the check post officer do is inform the constable before the highway to constrict the amount of car that can enter the highway at one moment
    3. So, Windowing is basically, the act of adjusting to the processing and acknowledgement time, *every packet must be acknowledged* in TCP and this can take time, but the time may not always be same throughout as variables tend to change
        1. As variables change `ACK` may become faster or slower, corresponding window becomes bigger and smaller.

*Segmentation* â†’ `What is it` ???

- [ ]  Segmentation is where, when the Transport Layer receives data from the session layer, it segregates the data into segments, whilst tagging them with a `SEQ` number, the `SEQ` number refers to the arrangement of the data. This segmenting gives a lot of advantages :
    - Smaller Data means faster transfer rates.
    - By only transmitting a Small portion of the data, it means if the bit is lost along the way only the small portion is lost, So, only the small portion has to be compensated for instead for the entire data.
    
    ![https://www.cs.ait.ac.th/~on/O/oreilly/tcpip/tcpip/figs/tcp2_0109.gif](https://www.cs.ait.ac.th/~on/O/oreilly/tcpip/tcpip/figs/tcp2_0109.gif)
    
    ![https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/TCP-connection-1.png](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/TCP-connection-1.png)
    
    In the transport Layer, the Source Port, Destination Port and others are tagged. This is important in making the data from the application layer, smaller and so that the overall data transfer is faster and efficient. In the transport layer, the header is a total of 20 bytes.
    
    Within, this Layer there are 2 main protocols and they are `TCP` and `UDP`.
    
    - `TCP - Transmission Control Protocol` â†’
        - TCP is a protocol that is used to establish a connection between the end-end users. TCP is a reliable form data transfer, this is because, TCP is a connection-oriented protocol. This allows the protocol to be a very reliable, form of connection over the networks. This is done so  via the `three-way handshake`
            1. **(SYN):**Â In the first step, the client wants to establish a connection with a server, so it sends a segment with `SYN`(Synchronize Sequence Number) which informs the server that the client is likely to start communication and with what sequence number it starts segments with
            2. **(SYN + ACK):**Â Server responds to the client request with `SYN-ACK` signal bits set. Acknowledgement(ACK) signifies the response of the segment it received and SYN signifies with what sequence number it is likely to start the segments with
            3. **(ACK):**Â In the final part client `acknowledges` the response of the server and they both establish a reliable connection with which they will start the actual data transfer
            
        - In the TCP, if a connection is to be established, it will use this 3-way handshake to establish it, and by doing so a reliable connection is made. Once this connection is made, the packets are either transmitted or received.
            - From the Transmitter/Sender POV :
                1. Each Segment is tagged with the SEQ number and Ack number, then passed on to the other layer where it becomes : `SEGMENT` â†’ `PACKET` â†’ `FRAME` â†’ `BITS` . 
                2. On the receiving side, the same process is repeat but reversed, in the Data Link layer, via LLC, can perform frame loss.
                3. Once the Segment is received in the receiver side, the receiver will send a acknowledgement to the sender
                    1. Sender â†’ sends Data
                    2. Receiver â†’ receives data and sends forth acknowledgement
                4. If a certain data is not acknowledged, the sender will retransmit it until acknowledged.
                    1. This can happen when data is discarded due to corruption in Data-Link
                    2. Data lost while Transfer due to collision
- `UDP - User Datagram Protocol` â†’
    - UDP is a protocol that is used to establish a connection just like `TCP` but the only difference here being is that `UDP` is connectionless protocol. The reason why it is connectionless, is because, there is no exact or controlled manner of transfer going on here.
        1. In `UDP` the data is basically blasted towards the host machine, it does not matter whether the host machine receives the packet or not, the Protocol does not matter, thus this protocol is mainly used in video streaming.
            1. This Protocol does result in data loss, but still the reason it is still applied in Video streaming is because, a small loss of packet would simply result in a loss of 1/100 second, which is barely noticeable in humanâ€™s eyes.
            2. Furthermore, unlike `TCP` where the 3-way handshake takes a certain period of time ; Letâ€™s assume the time taken to get one 3way is 0.02s (Probably smaller), If there are 100 Packets, in TCP the time take would be 2s+. Whilst in  `UDP` there is not handshake, so time is hundredth of 3way, meaning the transfer of 100packets is far faster. *Do note that UDP is commonly applied in Video Streaming*.

### Session Layer (Layer 5)

<aside>
â›” The session layer is responsible for connecting, maintaining and exchanging information with other device, as well as authentication.

</aside>

The session layer is the fifth layer in the OSI model, within this model, a lot of processes take place, Mainly, this session is responsible for establishing a dedicated communication line with another device- the device that sends the data i.e. the Sender.

This connection is supposed to be used for the exchange of information and other things, it also maintains this session and if needed terminates it.

**Functions of Session Layer :**The session layer being the fifth layer in the OSI model performs several different as well as important functions which are need for establishing as well as maintaining a safe and secure connection.

```
Data from Presentation Layer <=> Session layer <=> Data from Transport Layer
```

Following are some of the functions which are performed by Session Layer â€“

- Session Layer works as a dialog controller through which it allows systems to communicate in either half-duplex mode or full duplex mode of communication.
- This layer is also responsible for token management, through which it prevents two users to simultaneously access or attempting the same critical operation.
- This layer allows synchronization by allowing the process of adding checkpoints, which are considered as synchronization points to the streams of data.
- This layer is also responsible for session checkpointing and recovery.
- This layer basically provides a mechanism of opening, closing and managing a session between the end-user application processes.
- The services offered by Session Layer are generally implemented in application environments using remote procedure calls (RPCs).
- The Session Layer is also responsible for synchronizing information from different sources.
- This layer also controls single or multiple connections for each-end user application and directly communicates with both Presentation and transport layers.
- Session Layer creates procedures for checkpointing followed by adjournment, restart and termination.
- Session Layer uses checkpoints to enable communication sessions which are to be resumed from that particular checkpoint at which communication failure has occurred.
- The session Layer is responsible for fetching or receiving data information from its previous layer (transport layer) and further sends data to the layer after it (presentation layer).

**Session Layer Protocols :**Session Layer uses some protocols which are required for safe, secure and accurate communication which exists between two-ender user applications.Following are some of the protocols provided or used by the Session Layer â€“

- **[AppleTalk Data Stream Protocol (ADSP):](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/adsp-fullform/)**Â ADSP is that type of protocol which was developed by Apple Inc. and it includes a number of features that allow local area networks to be connected with no prior setup. This protocol was released in 1985.Â This protocol rigorously followed the OSI model of protocol layering. ADSP itself has two protocols named: AppleTalk Address Resolution Protocol (AARP) and Name Binding Protocol (NBP), both aimed at making system self-configuring.
- **[Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP):](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/real-time-transport-control-protocol-rtcp/)**Â RTCP is a protocol which provides out-of-band statistics and control information for an RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) session. RTCPâ€™s primary function is to provide feedback on the quality of service (QoS) in media distribution by periodically sending statistical information such as transmitted octet and packet counts or packet loss to the participants in the streaming multimedia session.
- **[Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP):](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pptp-full-form/)**Â PPTP is a protocol which provides a method for implementing virtual private networks. PPTP uses a TCP control channel and a Generic Routing Encapsulation tunnel to encapsulate PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) packets This protocol provides security levels and remote access levels comparable with typical VPN (Virtual Private Network) products.
- **[Password Authentication Protocol (PAP):](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/password-authentication-protocol-pap/)**Â Password Authentication Protocol is a password-based authentication protocol used by Point to Point Protocol (PPP) to validate users. Almost all network operating systems, remote servers support PAP. PAP authentication is done at the time of the initial link establishment and verifies the identity of the client using a two-way handshake (Client-sends data and server in return sends Authentication-ACK (Acknowledgement) after the data sent by client is verified completely).
- **[Remote Procedure Call Protocol (RPCP):](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remote-procedure-call-rpc-in-operating-system/)**Â Remote Procedure Call Protocol (RPCP) is a protocol that is used when a computer program causes a procedure (or a sub-routine) to execute in a different address space without the programmer explicitly coding the details for the remote interaction. This is basically the form of client-server interaction, typically implemented via a request-response message-passing system.
- **Sockets Direct Protocol (SDP):**Â Sockets Direct Protocol (SDP) is a protocol that supports streams of sockets over Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) network fabrics.The purpose of SDP is to provide an RDMA-accelerated alternative to the TCP protocol. The primary goal is to perform one particular thing in such a manner which is transparent to the application.
